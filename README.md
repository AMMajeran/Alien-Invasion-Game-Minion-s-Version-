# Alien-Invasion-Game-Minion-s-Version-

Game built with PyGame. If you want to play. Run the "alien_invasion.py" file. 

Game has different levels:
- If you hit all opponents in next level they will move faster, your character, and its bullet will move faster 
- Best score of all time will be stored in memory (text file) and loaded when you start new game
- I adjusted game to my preferences, and it looks like Minion's war :) 
- In settings file you can adjust parametes of game.
